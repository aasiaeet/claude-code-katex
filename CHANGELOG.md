# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **File links** (opt-in, `claudeCodeKatex.fileLinks`). Hovering a file link
  in a reply shows its full path, and right-click offers Open, Open with
  system app, Reveal in sidebar, Open containing folder, Copy full path and
  Copy link. A PDF, image or Office file that Claude Code opens as text is
  reopened in its proper viewer, and left-clicking a folder link opens the
  folder in the file manager. With the setting off, which is the default,
  the patch is unchanged.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added
- **Your own macros now render**
  ([#15](https://github.com/MahammadNuriyev62/claude-code-katex/issues/15)).
  Macros defined in a file separate from the conversation used to appear as red
  unrenderable commands. Point `claudeCodeKatex.macroFiles` at your `.tex`
  file(s), where `~`, `${workspaceFolder}` and `${userHome}` are supported, or
  define a few inline with `claudeCodeKatex.macros`.

  The file can be a slice of a real paper preamble: comments, `\usepackage`
  lines and prose are ignored, and a definition KaTeX cannot handle is skipped
  without affecting the others. `\newcommand`, `\renewcommand`,
  `\providecommand`, `\def`, `\let` and `\DeclareMathOperator` are understood
  (the last is emulated with `\operatorname`, which KaTeX has), and your
  definition wins over a KaTeX built-in of the same name such as `\vec` or
  `\argmax`. KaTeX still cannot do optional-argument macros or
  `\newenvironment`; those are reported as skipped rather than breaking the
  file.

  Macros are read when the window loads and refreshed by the new **Claude Code
  LaTeX: Reload Macros** command, also a button in the status popup, which now
  reports how many macros loaded and names any file it could not read.

  If anything about a macro file is wrong, math renders exactly as it does
  without the feature; a bad macro can never stop a formula from rendering.
  Users who configure no macros receive a byte-for-byte identical patch.

## [2.0.9] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- **`\label`, `\ref`, and `\eqref` no longer break formulas**
  ([#14](https://github.com/MahammadNuriyev62/claude-code-katex/issues/14)).
  KaTeX implements none of LaTeX's cross-referencing commands and rendered them
  as red `\label` errors spliced into the equation (common with prompts/skills
  that append `\label{eq:…}` to every formula). Now `\label{x}` renders
  invisibly as an anchor (`id="x"`, exactly like LaTeX), `\eqref{x}` renders as
  the readable reference `(x)`, and `\ref{x}` as `x`. Copying a labeled formula
  still yields its verbatim source including the `\label`.

## [2.0.8] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed
- **Copying rendered math now yields its LaTeX source.** Selecting an equation
  and copying used to put the rendered spans' garbled glyph text on the
  clipboard. KaTeX's official `copy-tex` extension now rewrites the copy: math
  in the selection becomes its original LaTeX — inline wrapped in `$…$`, display
  in `$$…$$` — ready to paste into a `.tex` file, Overleaf, or another chat. A
  partial selection inside a formula expands to the whole formula (matching
  KaTeX's behavior), and selections containing no math copy exactly as before.
  The contrib loads right after the KaTeX core; if the file is missing the
  extension degrades gracefully (math still renders, copying is just unfixed).

## [2.0.7] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- **Renders again on Claude Code 2.1.186+.** Claude Code minified its
  react-markdown call's JSX factory from `createElement(` to a short alias
  (`b(`), so the patch's injection matcher no longer recognized the call site
  and the extension reported "could not apply its patch" with no math rendering
  ([#11](https://github.com/MahammadNuriyev62/claude-code-katex/issues/11)). The
  matcher now captures the factory identifier instead of hard-coding
  `createElement`, so both the old longhand and the new alias forms are patched.
  Verified against every installed Claude Code build from 2.1.154 to 2.1.186.
- **Hardened the matcher against catastrophic backtracking.** Its identifier
  runs are now length-bounded, so scanning the multi-MB minified webview bundle
  stays linear instead of degrading to O(n²) on a long unbroken token run.

## [2.0.6] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **The status-bar item is now actionable.** Clicking the `∑ LaTeX` status item
  opens a popup with **Reload Webview** / **Reload Window** (and **Enable** /
  **Disable**) actions, instead of a read-only info message — so the reload
  controls are right where you'd reach for them.

## [2.0.5] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- **`\leftroot` / `\uproot` no longer break a root.** KaTeX does not implement
  these amsmath root-index positioning commands and errors on them, so
  `\sqrt[\leftroot-2\uproot2 n]{…}` showed a red parse error. They are purely
  cosmetic, so the pipeline now strips them (with their braced or unbraced numeric
  argument) and the expression renders as a normal `\sqrt[n]{…}`.
- **Display math with `\tag{…}` renders in every context.** Whole-line `$$…$$`,
  equations sharing a line with prose (`The result is $$…\tag{1}$$`), and
  equations as list items (`- $$…\tag{1}$$`) are all now moved onto their own
  block lines so remark-math parses them as *flow* (display) math — KaTeX `\tag`
  is display-only, so anywhere it was left inline it threw a katex-error.
  ([#8](https://github.com/MahammadNuriyev62/claude-code-katex/issues/8))
- **Inline math whose content starts with a digit now renders** — `$10^{-4}$`,
  `$2x$`, `$3t^2-2t^3$`, `$2x + y - z = 8$`. The v1.5 currency rule escaped
  *every* `$` immediately before a digit, which killed a legitimate *opening*
  delimiter and unbalanced the rest of the line. Replaced with Pandoc-style
  flanking rules: only a *closing* `$` that is preceded by a space or followed by
  a digit is treated as currency, so amounts (`$100`, `$5M`, `$50-$100`,
  `$3.50`) stay literal while digit-leading math renders.
  ([#9](https://github.com/MahammadNuriyev62/claude-code-katex/pull/9) — thanks @ReHoss)
- **Currency `$`s no longer pair across prose into a spurious math span.** Text
  like `"… in front ($5), but writing it after (5$) …"` previously turned
  *"5), but writing it after (5"* into italic math, because a digit-leading
  currency `$` is a valid math *opener* under the flanking rules. Now a
  digit-leading `$…$` span is rejected as currency only when its content reads
  like prose (two adjacent multi-letter words). This keeps real digit-leading
  math — including spaced equations like `$2x + y - z = 8$` — rendering, while
  currency discussions stay literal. Non-digit-leading math (`$a + b = c$`) is
  untouched.

### Development
- **Containerized test environment.** A single Docker image (`Dockerfile`,
  `docker/`) now runs all three test levels reproducibly, replacing reliance on a
  hand-maintained remote VS Code: L1 (jest) and L2 (the `v2-spike/test.html`
  rendering harness) need no secrets; L3 runs the real extension patching the
  real Claude Code in code-server and asserts KaTeX renders in the live webview.
  A token-free `smoke` target verifies the patch applies on activation. L3 auth
  uses a `claude setup-token` subscription token (not a metered API key). The
  image disables Workspace Trust, without which Claude Code (which declares
  `untrustedWorkspaces.supported = false`) and this extension never activate. See
  `docker/README.md`.

### Removed
- **Dead v1 test infrastructure.** The `test-ui/` suite (Playwright specs +
  harnesses + lightning.ai-hardcoded manual drivers), which tested the removed v1
  DOM-MutationObserver path via `_test.getMutationObserverScript()` (gone since
  2.0.0) and failed against v2, plus `playwright.config.js`, the `test:ui` /
  `build:react-harness` scripts, and the now-unused `react`, `react-dom`,
  `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`, and `jsdom` devDependencies.
- **`install.sh` / `uninstall.sh`** — the old manual v1 patch installer/remover.
  Installation is via the Marketplace; uninstall cleanup is handled by
  `uninstall-hook.js` (the `vscode:uninstall` hook).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- **Rendering rewritten.** Math now renders through Claude Code's own react-markdown plugin chain — `remark-math` + `rehype-katex` injected into the markdown pipeline — instead of a DOM post-processor running after render. `remark-math` tokenizes `$...$` / `$$...$$` during markdown parsing, so the LaTeX reaches KaTeX verbatim.

### Fixed
- **Matrices and other multi-row environments now render.** `\\` row separators (in `bmatrix`, `pmatrix`, `vmatrix`, `aligned`, `cases`, `array`, …) were collapsed to a single `\` by Claude Code's markdown parser before v1 ever saw them, so every row merged into one. v2 parses the math before that collapse happens.
- **`\[ ... \]` and `\( ... \)` delimiters now render.** Their backslashes were stripped (`\[` → `[`) before v1 could detect them. v2 normalizes these to `$$` / `$` ahead of parsing (fenced code blocks are left untouched).
- Multi-line display math containing a line that is only `=` no longer renders as a giant heading (a CommonMark setext-heading mis-parse).
- Backslash-escaped braces (`\{`, `\}`) and spacing macros (`\,`, `\;`, `\!`, `\:`) inside math now survive. v1's CommonMark layer stripped the backslash (`\;` → `;`, `\!` → `!`) before KaTeX saw it. ([#7](https://github.com/MahammadNuriyev62/claude-code-katex/issues/7))
- Underscore subscripts that CommonMark parsed as emphasis (`_..._` → `<em>`, dropping the `_`) are preserved — v2 parses the math before emphasis parsing runs. ([#7](https://github.com/MahammadNuriyev62/claude-code-katex/issues/7))

### Removed
- The entire v1 DOM post-processor — MutationObserver, debounce, the `$`/currency disambiguation pass, and the `Claude Code LaTeX: Re-render Math` command / `Ctrl+Alt+M` shortcut. Rendering is now part of React's render pass, so there is no flash of raw `$` during streaming and nothing to re-render manually.

### Notes
- If a future Claude Code build changes its bundle so the injection point can't be found, the extension leaves Claude Code untouched and shows a notice to update the extension (or report it) — rather than risk a broken patch.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- Animated demo GIF in the README and Marketplace listing. It walks through raw `$$...$$` in a Claude Code response, installing the extension, and the same math rendering live.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- Updating the extension now refreshes the code injected into Claude Code's webview. Previously the patch was version-agnostic, so an extension update kept the old injected code in place until Claude Code itself next updated. The patch now carries a version stamp; on activation a newer build detects an older or unstamped patch, restores the original webview files from backup, and re-applies the current patch. The refresh is guarded so it can never produce a double patch.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-15

### Changed
- The webview now reloads automatically when the patch is applied or removed (on startup, Enable, Disable, or after a Claude Code update). LaTeX rendering starts or stops without any manual reload.
- The confirmation notification keeps "Reload Webview" and "Reload Window" buttons as fallbacks, for the rare case the automatic reload does not take effect.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- Manual re-render trigger for issue #6 ("Math expressions sometimes remain as raw `$...$` during streaming until the window is reloaded"):
  - **Keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+M`** inside the Claude Code chat re-runs the render pass on the active message container.
  - **Command palette entry** "Claude Code LaTeX: Re-render Math" surfaces the shortcut and offers "Reload Webview" / "Reload Window" as heavier fallbacks.
  - **Status bar indicator** ("$(symbol-operator) LaTeX") always visible when Claude Code is patched. Clicking it triggers the rerender command.
  - `window.__claudeCodeKatexRerender` bridge exposed inside the webview for programmatic re-renders.

## [1.7.6] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- README updated to match "Claude Code LaTeX" naming (marketplace page).

## [1.7.5] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- Package size regression: 1.7.4 accidentally bundled development directories and ballooned to 17 MB. Restored to ~1 MB.

## [1.7.4] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- Command palette entries now say "Claude Code LaTeX: Enable / Disable / Status" (previously "KaTeX").
- Status messages and console logs updated to match.

## [1.7.3] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- Display name simplified to "Claude Code LaTeX". KaTeX is an implementation detail.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- Streaming messages with multiple math expressions now render all math, not just the last paragraph. Previously, rapid `characterData` mutations during streaming would overwrite the debounce closure's `mutations` argument, so only the last batch was processed — most paragraphs' math was never rendered and the message stayed as raw `$...$` until the user reloaded the window.

### Changed
- `renderNewNodes` replaced by `renderDirtyMessages`, which walks up from each mutation target to its `[data-testid="assistant-message"]` ancestor and renders the whole message. Handles characterData mutations, text-node additions, and element additions uniformly. No more `nodeType === 1` filter that silently skipped text-node additions.
- Mutations now accumulate across debounce callbacks (`pendingMutations`) instead of the closure capturing only the latest batch.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- DOM-range-based math preprocessing that correctly handles LaTeX split across multiple DOM nodes by remark's emphasis parsing (e.g. `$\tilde{T}_{\text{travel}}^{(k)}$`)
- Incremental rendering: only newly added/changed nodes are processed, not the entire chat container
- Observer disconnect/reconnect during rendering to prevent cascading mutation crashes

### Fixed
- `\left\{` and `\right\}` curly brace delimiters now render correctly. Claude Code's markdown parser (micromark) strips backslashes before punctuation, turning `\left\{` into invalid `\left{`. The extension now detects and restores these.
- Eliminated `removeChild` crash caused by MutationObserver firing during DOM manipulation

### Changed
- Replaced innerHTML-based preprocessing with surgical DOM node replacement, preserving React event handlers on `<a>` tags and other interactive elements

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- Pandoc `tex_math_dollars` rules for `$` disambiguation (currency vs math)
- 27 edge-case tests for dollar sign handling

### Fixed
- Currency amounts like `$5` and `$10` no longer incorrectly trigger math rendering

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Always prompt reload when activate() re-patches files after disable/enable cycle

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- 65 Jest tests covering extension lifecycle, patching, and observer behavior
- Scoped KaTeX rendering to messages container instead of entire `#root`

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- Initial release
- KaTeX rendering for `$...$` (inline) and `$$...$$` (display) math in Claude Code chat
- Auto-patch on startup with backup/restore
- MutationObserver for live rendering of streamed responses
- Commands: Enable, Disable, Check Status
- Clean uninstall hook
