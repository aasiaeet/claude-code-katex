# Claude Code LaTeX Extension

## Architecture

This extension patches Claude Code's webview to render LaTeX math via KaTeX.

(Display name is "Claude Code LaTeX"; the extension ID and repo name are still
`claude-code-katex` for marketplace continuity.)

The extension injects a math pipeline into Claude Code's own react-markdown
plugin chain, so math is tokenized *during* Markdown parsing — verbatim —
instead of being repaired in the DOM afterward.

- `applyPatch` (in `extension.js`) locates Claude Code's single react-markdown
  call — `createElement(<Markdown>, {remarkPlugins:[<gfm>], components:{...}},
  text)` — with `V2_INJECT_RE`, and rewrites it to add
  `rehypePlugins:[rehypeKatex]` and `remarkPlugins:[gfm, remarkBracketMath,
  remarkMath]`. The injected references are guarded on `window.__KATEX_V2_LOADED`
  so a bundle-load failure cannot break Claude Code's Markdown.
- It prepends, in order, `vendor/katex.min.js`, the optional KaTeX contrib
  `vendor/copy-tex.min.js` (copying a selection of rendered math yields its
  LaTeX source), and `vendor/remark-math-bundle.js` to the webview bundle
  (Claude Code mounts its React app at the end of the bundle, so the globals
  must be defined first). A missing contrib file degrades gracefully — core
  math still renders.
- If the injection point is not found — a future Claude Code reshaped its
  bundle — `applyPatch` returns `false`, touches nothing, and the extension
  shows an "update / report an issue" notice. There is no fallback renderer.

- When the user has configured macros (issue #15), a delimited block is emitted
  between the KaTeX core and the math bundle, setting
  `window.__KATEX_USER_PREAMBLE` / `window.__KATEX_USER_MACROS`. **With no
  macros configured no block is emitted at all**, so the patch stays
  byte-for-byte what it was before the feature — asserted by a jest snapshot
  written before the feature existed. Changing a macro rewrites only that block
  in place; it never restores and re-applies the patch.

The patch is version-stamped; an extension update restores the originals from
`.katex-bak` and re-applies. Claude Code's `extension.js` is **never modified** —
only the webview bundle (an isolated browser context) is patched.

## User macros — `macro-ingest.js`

Shared by both sides and therefore at the repo root, not in `src/webview/`:
`.vscodeignore` excludes `src/**`, and `extension.js` requires this module at
runtime. `src/webview/entry.js` bundles it for the webview; `extension.js` requires it
(with the UMD `vendor/katex.min.js`, which loads in Node) only to build the
report shown in the status popup — that require is fail-soft, since the webview
does its own ingestion.

It writes no LaTeX parser. KaTeX already reads `\newcommand` / `\def` / `\let`,
and with `globalGroup: true` it writes each definition into the `macros` object
passed to it, which later renders reuse. The module decides *what to hand
KaTeX*: definitions are extracted and everything else (`\usepackage`, prose,
comments) is dropped, `\DeclareMathOperator` is rewritten to `\operatorname`,
the whole file is tried in one render first, and only on failure is it applied
definition-by-definition so one bad line is isolated and reported. Each
definition is applied to a scratch copy and merged only on success. A
`\newcommand` KaTeX rejects because it already defines that name is retried as
`\renewcommand` (and vice versa) — the user's file states the intent plainly.

`ingestMacros` never throws; the worst outcome is an empty macros object.
Ingestion happens once at bundle load, never per render.

Two things to know when testing macros: ingestion reads the globals **at load**,
so a harness must set them before the bundle script tag; and an undefined macro
does not produce `.katex-error` — KaTeX renders it as red text
(`mathcolor="#cc0000"`), which is what issue #15 reports seeing.

## The math pipeline — `src/webview/entry.js`

`remark-math` only recognizes `$...$` / `$$...$$`. `remarkBracketMath` wraps the
Markdown parser to normalize the raw source before micromark runs:

- `\[`→`$$`, `\]`→`$$`, `\(`→`$`, `\)`→`$` — each guarded with `(?<!\\)` so
  amsmath row separators like `\\[6pt]` keep their `[` and are not corrupted.
- currency `$`+digit → `\$` (so `$5` is not treated as math).
- a `$$` display fence that shares its line with content (`$$\begin{aligned}` /
  `\end{aligned}$$`) is moved onto its own line — remark-math's display-math
  flow construct only recognizes `$$` alone on a line.
- fenced code blocks are skipped.

`entry.js` also wraps `rehype-katex` (`rehypeKatexWithCrossrefs`) to pass KaTeX
macros mapping LaTeX cross-referencing to renderable output — `\label{x}` →
invisible `\htmlId{x}{}` anchor (trust granted for that command only),
`\eqref{x}` → `\text{(x)}`, `\ref{x}` → `\text{x}` — since KaTeX errors on all
three (issue #14).

After editing `entry.js`, rebuild the shipped bundle:

```sh
npm run build:bundle
```

(esbuild IIFE; KaTeX is externalized to `window.katex` via
`src/webview/katex-global-shim.js`.)

## Where Claude Code lives

The extension auto-locates Claude Code via the `anthropic.claude-code` extension
id, so normal use needs no paths. For manual inspection, the extension folder is
under the VS Code extensions directory, which varies by setup:

- `~/.vscode/extensions/` — desktop VS Code
- `~/.vscode-server/extensions/` — Remote-SSH, WSL, Dev Containers, Codespaces
- `~/.local/share/code-server/extensions/` — code-server / browser VS Code

If more than one VS Code is in play, install into and test the instance you
actually use: plain `code --install-extension` targets your default desktop VS
Code; a remote or code-server instance has its own CLI.

## Before changing the webview patch

Verify against the actual compiled Claude Code webview bundle —
`webview/index.js` of the installed `anthropic.claude-code-*` extension. Claude
Code updates frequently and can reshape its bundle, so confirm the injection
point still matches before relying on it.

## Setup

`npm install` first (Node 18+) — it provides `jest`, `esbuild` (for the bundle
build), and `playwright`.

## Testing

All three test levels run inside one reproducible Docker image — no
hand-maintained remote VS Code, no machine-specific setup. This is the canonical
way to test, and the way a contributor verifies a fix. Full details:
[`docker/README.md`](docker/README.md).

```sh
docker build -t claude-code-katex-tests .

docker run --rm claude-code-katex-tests            # L1 + L2 (no secrets) — the everyday check
docker run --rm claude-code-katex-tests smoke      # L3 patch check (no secrets)
docker run --rm -e CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN="$(claude setup-token)" \
  claude-code-katex-tests all                      # L1 + L2 + L3 (real end-to-end)
```

`docker/entrypoint.sh` dispatches the levels; the Playwright base image tag is
pinned to the repo's `@playwright/test` version (keep them in lockstep).

### Level 1 — unit tests (no browser, no network, no auth)

`jest` — patch lifecycle (apply / refresh / remove), the `V2_INJECT_RE`
injection, the macro payload (`extension.macros.test.js`: path resolution,
size caps, embedding round-trips, in-place rewrite, hash invalidation), and
macro ingestion (`macro-ingest.test.js`, run against **`vendor/katex.min.js`** —
the build that ships, not the newer npm devDependency). In the container:
`docker run --rm img 1`. Locally: `node_modules/.bin/jest` (call the binary
directly; `npm test` can hit path issues).

### Level 2 — rendering harness (browser + network, no auth)

`test/harness/rendering.html` renders the real shipping bundle
(`vendor/remark-math-bundle.js`) through Claude Code's actual plugin chain
(`react-markdown` → `remark-math` → `rehype-katex`) and records a PASS/FAIL per
case on `window.__RESULTS` (`window.__DONE` flags completion). It pulls React
from a CDN, so it needs network. In the container (`docker run --rm img 2`),
`docker/run-harness.js` serves the repo, drives the page headless, and gates on
the results. Add a case to `rendering.html` for every rendering bug you fix.

`test/harness/macros.html` is the same harness with a user macro payload set
before the bundle loads. Keep `rendering.html` macro-free: it doubles as the guard
that configuring no macros changes nothing. `run-harness.js` drives both pages
(`HARNESS_URLS`, comma-separated; the older single-page `HARNESS_URL` still
works and expands to both).

### Level 3 — real end-to-end (browser + network + Claude auth)

The truest check: the **real** extension patching the **real** Claude Code in
code-server, asserting KaTeX renders in the live webview.

- `docker run --rm img smoke` — token-free. Installs the extension-under-test,
  launches code-server, and confirms the extension patched Claude Code's webview
  on activation (greps the patch marker, and that a configured macro payload
  reached it). Gates CI without any secret.
- `docker run --rm img macros` — token-free too, and stronger: attaches to the
  real Claude Code webview, reads `__KATEX_MACRO_REPORT` from the page, and
  renders with the resolved macros through the webview's own KaTeX. The webview
  bundle loads whether or not anyone is signed in, so no auth is needed. Kept
  out of `smoke` because it depends on the view-focus command and `smoke` must
  stay CI-robust.
- `docker run --rm -e CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=... img 3` — adds the live render.
  `docker/e2e.js` opens Claude Code, sends a prompt that asks Claude to echo a
  **fixed** block of LaTeX (so it tests the renderer, not the model), asserts
  `.katex` with zero `.katex-error`, then selects a display formula, presses a
  real `Ctrl+C`, and asserts the copy payload is the `$$`-wrapped LaTeX source
  (copy-tex live). Auth is a **subscription** token from
  `claude setup-token` (not a metered `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) or a mounted
  `~/.claude` — see `docker/README.md`.

Two environment facts the image bakes in, both required for L3 to work at all:

- **code-server, not desktop Electron VS Code** — only a browser-served VS Code
  can be driven this way. Find the webview iframe **by shape** (`#root` + a
  message input), never by URL.
- **Workspace Trust is disabled** (`security.workspace.trust.enabled: false`).
  Claude Code declares `capabilities.untrustedWorkspaces.supported = false`, so
  in a default (untrusted) workspace VS Code refuses to activate it *or* our
  extension, and no patch is applied. Without this, L3 silently does nothing.

The patched `webview/index.js` carries a `katex-ext-version: <x.y.z>` stamp;
`webview/index.js.katex-bak` is the pristine backup.

### Running outside Docker

L1 and L2 can also run on the host directly (`npm install`, Node 18+;
`npx playwright install chromium` once for the browser). L3 is Docker-only — it
needs the full code-server + Claude Code + auth stack the image provides.

## Submitting changes

- Rebuild and commit `vendor/remark-math-bundle.js` whenever you change
  `src/webview/entry.js`.
- Run levels 1–2 before committing; run level 3 for rendering changes.
- Add a `test/harness/rendering.html` regression case for any bug you fix.
- Keep commit messages in the existing style (`fix:`, `feat:`, `test:`,
  `docs:`, …).
