# Claude Code LaTeX

Adds LaTeX math rendering to the [Claude Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code) VSCode extension. Rendered with [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).

[![Open VSX](https://img.shields.io/open-vsx/v/nuriyev/claude-code-katex?label=Open%20VSX)](https://open-vsx.org/extension/nuriyev/claude-code-katex)

Temporary workaround for [anthropics/claude-code#16446](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16446) until native LaTeX rendering is added.

Renders inline math (`$...$`, `\(...\)`) and display math (`$$...$$`, `\[...\]`) in Claude's chat responses — including matrices and multi-line environments like `aligned`, `cases`, and `bmatrix`.

**Copy as LaTeX:** select any rendered equation and copy it — the clipboard gets the original LaTeX source (inline as `$...$`, display as `$$...$$`), ready to paste into a `.tex` file, Overleaf, or another chat.

## Old Demo

*Claude Code's raw `$$...$$` → rendered math, the moment the extension is installed.*

## Install

### From VS Code Marketplace

Search for **"Claude Code LaTeX"** in the Extensions tab, or:

```bash
code --install-extension nuriyev.claude-code-katex
```

### From Open VSX

For editors that cannot use the Microsoft Marketplace, such as VSCodium, Cursor
and Code OSS builds, the extension is published to
[Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/nuriyev/claude-code-katex) under the
same `nuriyev.claude-code-katex` id. Search for **"Claude Code LaTeX"** in the
Extensions tab, or:

```bash
codium --install-extension nuriyev.claude-code-katex
```

### From .vsix file

1. Download the latest `.vsix` from [Releases](https://github.com/MahammadNuriyev62/claude-code-katex/releases)
2. In VSCode: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Extensions: Install from VSIX...`
3. Reload when prompted

## Usage

The extension patches Claude Code automatically on startup. If you need manual control:

- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Claude Code LaTeX: Enable**
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Claude Code LaTeX: Disable**
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Claude Code LaTeX: Status**
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Claude Code LaTeX: Reload Macros**

## Your own macros

If you keep macros in a `.tex` file, point the extension at it and Claude's
math will use them instead of showing red errors:

```jsonc
{
  // Supports ~, ${workspaceFolder} and ${userHome}.
  "claudeCodeKatex.macroFiles": ["~/tex/macros.tex", "${workspaceFolder}/preamble.tex"],

  // Or define a few inline, in KaTeX's own form. These win on a shared name.
  "claudeCodeKatex.macros": {
    "\\RR": "\\mathbb{R}",
    "\\vv": "\\mathbf{#1}"
  }
}
```

The file can be a slice of a real paper preamble. Comments, `\usepackage`
lines and prose are ignored, and a definition KaTeX cannot handle is skipped
without affecting the rest. `\newcommand`, `\renewcommand`, `\providecommand`,
`\def`, `\let` and `\DeclareMathOperator` are all understood, and your
definition wins over a KaTeX built-in of the same name (`\vec`, `\argmax`).

Macros are read when the window loads. After editing a macro file, run
**Claude Code LaTeX: Reload Macros** (also a button in the status popup, which
reports how many macros loaded and names any file it could not read).

Two things KaTeX itself cannot do, so neither can this:

- macros with an optional argument, `\newcommand{\x}[2][default]{...}`
- `\newenvironment`

## File links

Turn on `"claudeCodeKatex.fileLinks": true` for more control over the file
links in Claude's replies. Hovering a file link shows its full path. Right-click
it for:

- **Open**: PDFs and images open in their viewer (a PDF viewer extension such
  as LaTeX Workshop, or VS Code's image preview), Office documents in your
  system app, and text files at the linked line
- **Open with system app**
- **Reveal in sidebar**, for files inside the workspace
- **Open containing folder**, in your system file manager
- **Copy full path** and **Copy link**

Claude Code opens a clicked file as text, which shows a PDF as raw bytes. With
this setting on, a PDF, image or Office file that opens as text is closed and
reopened in its proper viewer, and left-clicking a folder link opens the
folder in your file manager. Web links keep Claude Code's own menu.

The menu's actions go through a `vscode://` link to this extension, so the
first one asks once whether to allow it. The handler only opens, reveals or
shows files, and it will not hand scripts or executables to the system app.

## How it works

The extension injects `remark-math` and `rehype-katex` into Claude Code's own Markdown rendering pipeline. Math is tokenized *while* Claude Code parses the Markdown — before the parser can alter it — so the LaTeX reaches KaTeX exactly as written. This is what lets backslash-heavy expressions (matrix row breaks `\\`, spacing macros `\,` `\;` `\!`, escaped braces) and multi-line environments render correctly.

It patches Claude Code's webview bundle on startup and reloads the webview so rendering takes effect immediately. When Claude Code updates, the patch is automatically re-applied. If a future Claude Code build changes its internals so the patch no longer fits, the extension leaves Claude Code untouched and notifies you to update.

`extension.js` of Claude Code is **never modified**. Only the webview bundle (which runs in an isolated browser context) is patched, and originals are backed up.

## Disabling / Uninstalling

To **temporarily disable** LaTeX rendering, use the command:

`Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Claude Code LaTeX: Disable**. The webview reloads automatically.

To **re-enable**, use **Claude Code LaTeX: Enable**.

**Uninstalling** the extension from the Extensions panel automatically cleans up the patch.

> **Why not the Disable button in the Extensions panel?** The patch lives in Claude Code's webview files on disk. Claude Code loads its webview before this extension activates, so if we removed the patch on deactivate, the webview would load unpatched files before we could re-apply. Keeping files patched on disk ensures it works reliably across restarts.

## Known Limitations

- Rendering covers everything KaTeX supports — essentially all standard math notation. A few full-LaTeX features outside its scope (such as TikZ diagrams) are not rendered.
- Code blocks are never affected. `$variable` inside `` `code` `` or code fences is left alone.
- This is a temporary workaround until [anthropics/claude-code#16446](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16446) is resolved. Once Claude Code ships native LaTeX support, this extension can be uninstalled.

## Bugs & Feedback
