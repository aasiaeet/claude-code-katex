# Claude Code LaTeX

Adds LaTeX math rendering to the [Claude Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code) VSCode extension. Rendered with [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).

[![Open VSX](https://img.shields.io/open-vsx/v/nuriyev/claude-code-katex?label=Open%20VSX)](https://open-vsx.org/extension/nuriyev/claude-code-katex)

Temporary workaround for [anthropics/claude-code#16446](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16446) until native LaTeX rendering is added.

Renders inline math (`$...$`, `\(...\)`) and display math (`$$...$$`, `\[...\]`) in Claude's chat responses — including matrices and multi-line environments like `aligned`, `cases`, and `bmatrix`.

**Copy as LaTeX:** select any rendered equation and copy it — the clipboard gets the original LaTeX source (inline as `$...$`, display as `$$...$$`), ready to paste into a `.tex` file, Overleaf, or another chat.

## Old Demo

*Claude Code's raw `$$...$$` → rendered math, the moment the extension is installed.*

## Install

### From VS Code Marketplace

Search for **"Claude Code LaTeX"** in the Extensions tab, or:

```bash
code --install-extension nuriyev.claude-code-katex
```

### From Open VSX

For editors that cannot use the Microsoft Marketplace, such as VSCodium, Cursor
and Code OSS builds, the extension is published to
[Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/nuriyev/claude-code-katex) under the
same `nuriyev.claude-code-katex` id. Search for **"Claude Code LaTeX"** in the
Extensions tab, or:

```bash
codium --install-extension nuriyev.claude-code-katex
```

### From .vsix file

1. Download the latest `.vsix` from [Releases](https://github.com/MahammadNuriyev62/claude-code-katex/releases)
2. In VSCode: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Extensions: Install from VSIX...`
3. Reload when prompted

## Usage

The extension patches Claude Code automatically on startup. If you need manual control:

- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Claude Code LaTeX: Enable**
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Claude Code LaTeX: Disable**
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Claude Code LaTeX: Status**
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Claude Code LaTeX: Reload Macros**

## Your own macros

If you keep macros in a `.tex` file, point the extension at it and Claude's
math will use them instead of showing red errors:

```jsonc
{
  // Supports ~, ${workspaceFolder} and ${userHome}.
  "claudeCodeKatex.macroFiles": ["~/tex/macros.tex", "${workspaceFolder}/preamble.tex"],

  // Or define a few inline, in KaTeX's own form. These win on a shared name.
  "claudeCodeKatex.macros": {
    "\\RR": "\\mathbb{R}",
    "\\vv": "\\mathbf{#1}"
  }
}
```

The file can be a slice of a real paper preamble. Comments, `\usepackage`
lines and prose are ignored, and a definition KaTeX cannot handle is skipped
without affecting the rest. `\newcommand`, `\renewcommand`, `\providecommand`,
`\def`, `\let` and `\DeclareMathOperator` are all understood, and your
definition wins over a KaTeX built-in of the same name (`\vec`, `\argmax`).

Macros are read when the window loads. After editing a macro file, run
**Claude Code LaTeX: Reload Macros** (also a button in the status popup, which
reports how many macros loaded and names any file it could not read).

Two things KaTeX itself cannot do, so neither can this:

- macros with an optional argument, `\newcommand{\x}[2][default]{...}`
- `\newenvironment`

## Annotating replies

Turn on `"claudeCodeKatex.annotate": true` to comment on specific parts of a
reply. Select text in one of Claude's replies and a one-line note box appears
over the selection. Type your comment and press Enter (or click the check
button that appears); the quote and your comment are added to the prompt box:

```
Annotation 1:
> the text you selected
My comment:
what you typed
```

Add as many as you like before sending; they are numbered in order. Selected
math is quoted as its LaTeX source, and a selection that cuts into an equation
is widened to the whole equation. Shift+Enter adds a line to the note, Esc
cancels, and pressing Enter before typing anything adds the quote alone. The
`Annotation N:` and `My comment:` lines are drawn bold in the prompt box and in
your sent message.

Each annotated span keeps a small numbered balloon. Hover it to see your
comment; click it to edit the comment in place, and Save (or Enter) rewrites
that annotation in the prompt box. The trash button deletes the whole
annotation, quote included, and renumbers the rest. The prompt box stays the source of
truth: edit a comment there by hand and the balloon shows your edit, delete an
annotation there and its balloon goes too. Sending the prompt clears them all.

The note box leaves your selection alone until you type or paste, so Ctrl+C
still copies it. Reply text also stays selectable in Claude Code's Focus view,
which otherwise turns selection off for replies. The feature is off by default and changing the setting takes effect
right away.

## How it works

The extension injects `remark-math` and `rehype-katex` into Claude Code's own Markdown rendering pipeline. Math is tokenized *while* Claude Code parses the Markdown — before the parser can alter it — so the LaTeX reaches KaTeX exactly as written. This is what lets backslash-heavy expressions (matrix row breaks `\\`, spacing macros `\,` `\;` `\!`, escaped braces) and multi-line environments render correctly.

It patches Claude Code's webview bundle on startup and reloads the webview so rendering takes effect immediately. When Claude Code updates, the patch is automatically re-applied. If a future Claude Code build changes its internals so the patch no longer fits, the extension leaves Claude Code untouched and notifies you to update.

`extension.js` of Claude Code is **never modified**. Only the webview bundle (which runs in an isolated browser context) is patched, and originals are backed up.

## Disabling / Uninstalling

To **temporarily disable** LaTeX rendering, use the command:

`Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Claude Code LaTeX: Disable**. The webview reloads automatically.

To **re-enable**, use **Claude Code LaTeX: Enable**.

**Uninstalling** the extension from the Extensions panel automatically cleans up the patch.

> **Why not the Disable button in the Extensions panel?** The patch lives in Claude Code's webview files on disk. Claude Code loads its webview before this extension activates, so if we removed the patch on deactivate, the webview would load unpatched files before we could re-apply. Keeping files patched on disk ensures it works reliably across restarts.

## Known Limitations

- Rendering covers everything KaTeX supports — essentially all standard math notation. A few full-LaTeX features outside its scope (such as TikZ diagrams) are not rendered.
- Code blocks are never affected. `$variable` inside `` `code` `` or code fences is left alone.
- This is a temporary workaround until [anthropics/claude-code#16446](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16446) is resolved. Once Claude Code ships native LaTeX support, this extension can be uninstalled.
